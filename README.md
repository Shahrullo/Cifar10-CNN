# Cifar10-CNN

Convolutional Neural Network project based on Cifar-10 dataset from [Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). 
Depending on the exercise in CNN part I made a model to work on the project. With the simple architecture and carefully chosen hyperparameters, the accuracy has increased to 84%

## About the project
The project shows classifying of CIFAR-10 database. The database is consisted of images that are small color that fall into one of ten classes.
